          This website outlines one of my favorite past-times and passions -
          singing.
        </p>
        <p>
          From a young age, I liked to lipsync and sing songs and I would often
          put on 'Saturday Morning Concerts' for my parents as they drank their
          morning coffee in the living room.
        </p>
        <p>
          I would dress up and sometimes paint my face for these 'concerts.' I
          performed in my mother's fancy shoes and jewelry, or my dad's leather
          jacket with one of his ties around my forehead, and sometimes I would
          dust off the old Halloween costumes, like my ladybug, and perform
          entire <abbr>CDs</abbr> worth of songs.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the age of 11, I started teaching myself classical guitar, and
          received my first electric guitar for Christmas at 14. From there, I
          would enjoy playing inn jam sessions in the basement with my friends,
          and was part of a group of kids in school that also enjoyed playing
          and performing music. I got my first acoustic guitar at 16 and then
          started writing comical songs and enjoyed playing for friends and
          family.
        </p>
        <p>
          Later in life, I have joined various choirs and was a singer in a
          11-piece funk band, and even secured positions with a local musical
          theatre group. I have always loved singing and try to continue doing
          as much as I can.
        </p>
        <p>
          Use the navigation tools to jump to sections of my career and
          experience in singing and I hope you enjoy some of the performance
          videos.
        </p>
        <p>Cheers x</p>
