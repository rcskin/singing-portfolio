            <h4>Experience</h4>
            <p>
              I started by doing <strong>karaoke</strong> at local pubs as well
              as singing while playing guitar. I won a few prizes at karaoke
              nights and was asked to perform for a girl trying to be the next
              Taylor Swift as a backup singer while recording an album. I then
              joined Celebration Singers choir, a womens' choir that my mother
              was the director of. There I met a fellow member who was looking
              for a backup singer in their funk band, Groove Engine.
            </p>
            <p>
              I performed with Celebration Singers and Groove Engine for a
              while, joined a Rock Choir, and then auditioned for the local
              musical theatre company, The Actor's Studio, and was cast in a few
              musicals, including Elf, Shrek, and The Addams Family.
              Unfortunately before getting to perform in those shows, I moved to
              London, UK to get experience as a science teacher.

                In London I wanted to continue singing. I was then bouncing
                around different choirs trying to sing as much as I could, but
                to also find something similar to what I had back in Canada.
                </p>

                <p>
                I joined a gospel choir, and really enjoyed singing soul music,
                but didn't like the religious songs we occasionally sang. I did
                one performance with them, and then joined a choir that was
                closer to where I lived. The new choir was called West End
                Musical Choir and was really fun music, <em>EXACTLY</em> the
                kind I wanted to sing. I did some performances with them, and
                was invited to sing on their recording session at
                <strong>Abbey Road Studios</strong>. The choir was fun, but
                anyone could join, including people who didn't know much about
                singing so I found the songs too simplistic. They were also
                trying to recruit as many people as possible, so the choir
                performances became quite crowded.
                </p>

                <p>
                I took a long break after that and decided to join another
                musical theater choir, Sing Space, and did a performance with
                them. However, the amount of rehearsals and not very many
                performance opportunities, meant that I wasn't fully in it, and
                decided to wait until I can find something with more performance
                opportunities with experienced singers!
