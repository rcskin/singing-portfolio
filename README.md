# singing-portfolio
A larger project and one of first in our Front-End module of Bootcamp. Uses HTML, CSS, and JS.
Task was to make a webpage based on a hobby or a portfolio you would like to make. 
I made a portfolio project for my singing hobby with my performance and professional experience.

The JS part of the task was to add many 'like' and 'save for later' buttons that had to be functional.
Aesthetically it is not pleasing with these added task requirements, but it does show what skills I learned from this task.
